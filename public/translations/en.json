    "about": [
      "I’m Caio Uehara Martins, a Brazilian computer-science undergraduate at the University of São Paulo (USP – Ribeirão Preto, class of 2026) who loves turning code into real-world impact. My work lives where software engineering meets applied AI for healthcare: I build and validate neural-network pipelines for digital dentistry with the InReDD research group, and our clinical-decision tool was showcased at SBCAS 2024.",
      "Beyond the lab, I sharpen quality-engineering skills as an SW QA Assistant at Foretellix, stress-testing AD/ADAS platforms to keep autonomous-driving software safe. I’m also the founder and president of OctoBit Jr., USP’s computer-science junior enterprise, where I lead multidisciplinary teams, scope client projects, and model agile processes end-to-end. Earlier, as a Startup Manager intern at FEA Angels, I bridged investors and early-stage startups through data-driven deal-flow analysis.",
      "Technically, I’m fluent in React / Next.js, TypeScript, Python, Java, C++, Docker and Linux. My academic passions span computer vision, image processing and numerical analysis.",
      "When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me enjoying music and my hobbie is deejaying eletronic songs. Beside that I engaje on production of festival, drawing on experiences that taught me resilience, logistics and the thrill of crafting unforgettable user experiences. Having lived and studied in London and Vancouver, I’m comfortable in multicultural teams and speak English (C1) and Spanish (B1)."
